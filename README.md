## Installation<a name="installation"></a>

The project is a Python 3.6+ project and its library dependencies will need to be installed before it 
can be run. 

It is recommended to install libraries in a dedicated virtual environement. The dependencies 
requirements can be found in **requirements.txt** file. For example, the dependencies can be
installed using the following commands after activation of the virtual environment:

```
> cd /path/to/blogpost
> pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

I chose to study 2016 Airbnb-related data for the city of Seattle, WA, USA; the data used 
provides a snapshot of the listing activity in Seattle on 4 January, 2016.

I was interested in answering the following three questions:

1. Where are Airbnb listings located in Seattle? Can we identify strong variations across
its neighbourhoods?
2. When is the best time to visit Seattle?
3. Is it possible to predict the price of a listing?

The observations and findings would then be communicated through a blogpost. 

## File Descriptions<a name="files"></a>

The project contains a set of data files as well as two Jupyter notebooks. 

The notebooks detail the work completed in answering the above questions, as well as 
associated notes and comments which allow the reader to follow my train of thought.

**notebook-Q1Q2.ipynb** relates to the first two questions while **notebook-Q3.ipynb** relates
to the last question only. 

## Results<a name="results"></a>

A blopgpost was written to communicate the findings of this project; it is available [here](https://medium.com/@tourekadija02_12756/booking-an-airbnb-in-seattle-wa-heres-what-you-should-know-40547e0059ee).

The data comes from [Inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/), a mission-driven project that provides advocacy about the
impact of short term rentals on housing and residential communities. The data uses public information that has been
compiled from the Airbnb website. The Licensing for the data as well as further descriptive information can be found at
